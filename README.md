# Golang Algorithms with OpenAPI spec

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations in Golang. Additionally, it includes examples and exercises for working with OpenAPI specifications and generating code using `oapi-codegen`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following tools installed:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen)
- [guregu](https://github.com/guregu/null)

### File and Folder Structure

This project is organized as follows:
 * generated folder: contains the generated code that is generated by oapi-codegen. 
      #### - When you run `make build`, `api.gen.go` that will be generated in this folder.
      #### - You cannot modify this `api.gen.go` file, but you can use it as a reference for your implementation.
 * handler folder: contains the handler code for the server
 * openapi folder: contains the OpenAPI specification and configuration files.
      #### - openapi.yaml: the main OpenAPI specification file.
      #### - model.yaml: the model definition file. It might contain some custom types/struct like request/response body even error response. this file will be joined by `make build` with openapi.yaml to generate the final openapi.yaml.
      #### - {other}.yaml: the OpenAPI specification for each endpoint.
